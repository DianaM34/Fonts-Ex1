					<h2>The end</h2>
				During the early years of Capon Chapel, no Protestant denomination was the exclusive owner or occupant, and the church was probably utilized as a "union church" for worship by any Christian denomination. Capon Chapel was used as a place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. In the 1890s, Capon Chapel was added as a place of worship on the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. As of 2012, Capon Chapel remains a Methodist church, now a part of the United Methodist Church, holding Methodist services twice a month.
	
	Capon Chapel's cemetery is surrounded by a wrought iron fence made by Stewart Iron Works, and contains the remains of John Monroe, William C. Nixon, West Virginia House of Delegates member Captain David Pugh (1806–1899), American Civil War veterans from the Union and the Confederacy, and free and enslaved African Americans. Capon Chapel, along with its cemetery, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, in recognition of its representation of the rural religious architecture of the Potomac Highlands region, and for its service as an important rural church in Hampshire County.

					<h2>The start</h2>
				In addition to the Baptist faith, Methodists started coming to the Cacapon River Valley during the latter half of the 18th century.[25] Methodist Episcopal Church circuit rider Francis Asbury traveled through the Capon Bridge area in 1781.[25] In 1890, the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church established its presence in the Capon Bridge area under the leadership of G. O. Homan.[16][20] According to Maxwell and Swisher, the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit consisted of the following places in 1897: Capon Bridge, North River Mills, Green Mound, Augusta, Sedan, Park's Hollow, Sandy Ridge, and Capon Chapel.[26] Capon Chapel was not commonly used as a Baptist place of worship by the early 20th century, and developed into a permanent stop along the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit, which later grew to include Central Church at Loom and Bethel Church at Neals Run.[16][20][26] In 1976, the circuit's pastor was Thomas Malcolm.[20]

Capon Chapel remains a Methodist church, now a part of the United Methodist Church.[16][27] As of 2015, Capon Chapel's congregation numbers five.[27] The church's Methodist circuit pastor is M. Christopher Duckworth; and it offers services four Sundays a month.[27] A small group of committed congregants maintain the historic church and cemetery grounds.[16] Brenda Hiett is the church's caretaker, as of 2012.[8] Throughout its existence, Capon Chapel has been known by various names, including "Capon Baptist Chapel" and "Capon Chapel Church".[5]

					<h2>Recreation</h2>
				The cemetery is less than an acre in size and is located to the immediate east of the church, surrounded by a wrought iron fence manufactured by Stewart Iron Works.[28] As of 2012, the cemetery contains approximately 270 interments, including[28] John Monroe (1750–1824), Virginia House of Delegates member William C. Nixon (1789–1869), West Virginia House of Delegates member Captain David Pugh (1806–1899), American Civil War veterans from the Union and the Confederacy, and free and enslaved African Americans.[23][30][31] Gertrude Ward (1896–1988), a local historian and orchardist, is also interred in the cemetery.[31][32] Captain David Pugh was an elected representative Hampshire County, who voted to secede from the Union in 1861.[28]

Older gravestones in the cemetery are generally cut from limestone, and the gravestones placed after 1900 are predominantly made of polished granite. Most of the gravestones have weathered significantly. The gravestones are generally rounded or rectangular in shape, and are placed on small stone foundations. The gravestones of prominent local leaders are more ornate in character, including that of Captain David Pugh and his family, who are buried under a large obelisk that lists the names of his three wives and their respective children. Nixon's gravestone is deteriorating due to advanced weathering; it is made of limestone and contains a carving of an open book. Following the purchase of a rectangular land tract around 1990, the cemetery was expanded on the east side. This section of the cemetery is excluded from the church's historically-recognized boundaries, as it was not associated with the church during the period of its greatest significance.[28]

The cemetery perimeter is lined on three sides by a cast wrought iron fence, accessible by a gate 3 feet (0.91 m) in width at its western entryway.[28] The wrought iron fence is 4 feet (1.2 m) in height, and has approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) diameter tubular fence posts, which are supported by three horizontal metal rails.[28] The fence posts are capped with white-painted stylized arrows, with a ball at the tip.[28] A shield with the emblem reading, "The Stewart Iron Works, Cincinnati, Ohio", is emblazoned on the fence's gate.[28] The cemetery's eastern extension is surrounded by chain-link fencing.[33]
